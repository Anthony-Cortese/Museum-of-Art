          "Pollock chose to use liquid paints. More specifically, they were synthetic resin paints (gloss enamel)[2] but are referred to as oil paints for classification of the work. On inspection it was grey, brown, white and yellow paint drizzled in a way that many people still perceive as a dense bird’s nest Initial reactions to the work were underwhelming",

To the right are the faintly visible domes of Santa Maria della Salute and the mouth of the Grand Canal.",
