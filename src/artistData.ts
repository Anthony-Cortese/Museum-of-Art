On inspection it was grey, brown, white and yellow paint drizzled in a way that many people still perceive as a dense bird’s nest Initial reactions to the work were underwhelming",

The forms are gently inserted, though not enough to disguise their identity. The painting focuses on the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore with its bell tower rising to the top of the painting. To the right are the faintly visible domes of Santa Maria della Salute and the mouth of the Grand Canal.",
